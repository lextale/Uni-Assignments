Do Abrasions casuse scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation. We give water or other non-alcoholic drinks.

It's important to stay as calm as possible during a seizure, as anxiety or stress can make the seizure worse. If possible, move away from any potential hazards or dangerous objects. If you are unable to move, try to cover your head with something soft to prevent injury. Do not try to move or walk during the seizure, as this can increase the risk of injury. If this is your first seizure or if the seizure lasts longer than five minutes, call for emergency medical services. Even if you have had seizures before, it's a good idea to consult with a doctor to discuss the best treatment options and to ensure that the underlying cause of the seizure is properly diagnosed and treated. After the seizure, give yourself time to rest and recover. Take any medications prescribed by your doctor as directed, and follow up with any recommended medical appointments or tests.

Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration.

<PAD> hypothermia Low <PAD> <PAD> bodyes <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> temperature
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days.

How to cute Fainting?
Fainting, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. If you witness someone fainting, it's important to act quickly and catch the person and ease them to the ground to prevent further injury. Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall. Meanwhile, you can perform CPR. If you feel like you're going to pass out, lie down and place your legs higher or sit with your head between your legs.

Hot to cure Fainting?
Fainting, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. If you witness someone fainting, it's important to act quickly and catch the person and ease them to the ground to prevent further injury. Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall. Meanwhile, you can perform CPR. If you feel like you're going to pass out, lie down and place your legs higher or sit with your head between your legs.

If this is not possible, look for a dry bad electrical conductor (wood, plastic, broomstick, bed board, etc.) to remove the electrical conductor or the victim. Before attempting any first aid intervention, check if the person is conscious and responsive. If they are not, call for emergency medical services immediately. Check the victim for movement, coughing and normal breathing. If the person is unresponsive, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP.For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise.  Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention.

head stroke <PAD> <PAD> heatstroke High body <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> tempreture
Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation. We give water or other non-alcoholic drinks.

Do Abrasions course scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation. We give water or other non-alcoholic drinks.

Heat stroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

<PAD> Do <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> Abrasions <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> casuse <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

hypothermia Low body <PAD>
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall. Meanwhile, you can perform CPR. If you feel like you're going to pass out, lie down and place your legs higher or sit with your head between your legs.

hypothermia Low bory temperature
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

what to do is <PAD> get a Haet Stroke?
Heat stroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

hypothermia Low body <PAD> temparture
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

De Abrasions cause scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

Do Abrasions because <PAD>
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days.

Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

Heat stroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

De Abrasions cause <PAD>
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration.

DO NOT touch with bare hands electrically conductive objects or liquids that they've been submerged in. Turn off the electricity. The high voltage current can be transmitted for several meters around the victim. Look for the main power switch and turn it off. If this is not possible, look for a dry bad electrical conductor (wood, plastic, broomstick, bed board, etc.) to remove the electrical conductor or the victim. Before attempting any first aid intervention, check if the person is conscious and responsive. If they are not, call for emergency medical services immediately. Check the victim for movement, coughing and normal breathing. If the person is unresponsive, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP.For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise.  Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention.

Does <PAD> cause scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. If we become aware of the possibility of abandonment, we break the car window and remove the trapped person while simultaneously calling 116 or 112.

car head stroke heatstroke higt body temperature
Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. If we become aware of the possibility of abandonment, we break the car window and remove the trapped person while simultaneously calling 116 or 112. So when we find a person in a similar environment who presents: red, warm and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

hypothermia Low <PAD> body <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> temperatrue
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

Hom to cure Bleeding?
To treat a bleeding caused by a skin wound begin with washed hands. Wash the wound with normal saline or plenty of clean water with a sterile gauze, cotton or a clean piece of cloth. Gently remove any dirt, glass or other materials if possible. If the wound is bleeding put pressure with a clean gauze or cloth continuously for a few minutes. When the bleeding stops clean the wound with antiseptic solution and cover it with a sterile adhesive bandage or wrap it with a sterile gauze pad and adhesive tape. Avoid covering the wound with cotton, because it can stick into the wound. If foreign objects cannot be removed, seek medical help. Change the wound every one to two days until it heals the wound. If you notice inflammation, intense swelling and redness or persisting pain, you should contact a doctor for the possible administration of an antibiotic, because the wound is infected. If the trauma was caused by a rusty object you must have a tetanus shot from a healthcare professional. For other types of bleeding like a nose bleeding, please specify to receive the according instructions and information.

Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. If we become aware of the possibility of abandonment, we break the car window and remove the trapped person while simultaneously calling 116 or 112. So when we find a person in a similar environment who presents: red, warm and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

When the bleeding stops clean the wound with antiseptic solution and cover it with a sterile adhesive bandage or wrap it with a sterile gauze pad and adhesive tape. Avoid covering the wound with cotton, because it can stick into the wound. If foreign objects cannot be removed, seek medical help. Change the wound every one to two days until it heals the wound. If you notice inflammation, intense swelling and redness or persisting pain, you should contact a doctor for the possible administration of an antibiotic, because the wound is infected. If the trauma was caused by a rusty object you must have a tetanus shot from a healthcare professional.

Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute.

<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> Does <PAD> <PAD> Abrasions <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> cause <PAD> scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache.

Do Abrasions casuse scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

hypothermia Low body temperature
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

Heat stroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> Do Abrasions <PAD> because scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache.

How do ypi treate Heat Exhaustion?
Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation. We give water or other non-alcoholic drinks.

<PAD> Abrasions cause scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

Do <PAD> casuse scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help.

Do Abrasions cause scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

hypothermia Low <PAD> tempeture
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

Fainting, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. If you witness someone fainting, it's important to act quickly and catch the person and ease them to the ground to prevent further injury. Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall. Meanwhile, you can perform CPR. If you feel like you're going to pass out, lie down and place your legs higher or sit with your head between your legs.

Do <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> Abrasions <PAD> <PAD> because <PAD> scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

How <PAD> cure Fainting?
Fainting, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. If you witness someone fainting, it's important to act quickly and catch the person and ease them to the ground to prevent further injury. Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall. Meanwhile, you can perform CPR. If you feel like you're going to pass out, lie down and place your legs higher or sit with your head between your legs.

How to <PAD> Bleeding?
To treat a bleeding caused by a skin wound begin with washed hands. Wash the wound with normal saline or plenty of clean water with a sterile gauze, cotton or a clean piece of cloth. Gently remove any dirt, glass or other materials if possible. If the wound is bleeding put pressure with a clean gauze or cloth continuously for a few minutes. When the bleeding stops clean the wound with antiseptic solution and cover it with a sterile adhesive bandage or wrap it with a sterile gauze pad and adhesive tape. Avoid covering the wound with cotton, because it can stick into the wound. If foreign objects cannot be removed, seek medical help. Change the wound every one to two days until it heals the wound. If you notice inflammation, intense swelling and redness or persisting pain, you should contact a doctor for the possible administration of an antibiotic, because the wound is infected. If the trauma was caused by a rusty object you must have a tetanus shot from a healthcare professional. For other types of bleeding like a nose bleeding, please specify to receive the according instructions and information.

Hoe do yoo treat Heat Stroke?
Heat stroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation. We give water or other non-alcoholic drinks.

Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. If we become aware of the possibility of abandonment, we break the car window and remove the trapped person while simultaneously calling 116 or 112. So when we find a person in a similar environment who presents: red, warm and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement.

Does Abrasions cause scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

Do Abrasions because scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

electrocuted infant cild adult
DO NOT touch with bare hands electrically conductive objects or liquids that they've been submerged in. Turn off the electricity. The high voltage current can be transmitted for several meters around the victim. Look for the main power switch and turn it off. If this is not possible, look for a dry bad electrical conductor (wood, plastic, broomstick, bed board, etc.) to remove the electrical conductor or the victim. Before attempting any first aid intervention, check if the person is conscious and responsive. If they are not, call for emergency medical services immediately. Check the victim for movement, coughing and normal breathing. If the person is unresponsive, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP.For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise.  Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention.

Fainting, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. If you witness someone fainting, it's important to act quickly and catch the person and ease them to the ground to prevent further injury. Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall. Meanwhile, you can perform CPR. If you feel like you're going to pass out, lie down and place your legs higher or sit with your head between your legs.

Do Abrasions <PAD> casuse <PAD> <PAD> scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

hypothermia Low body temperatrue
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

DO NOT touch with bare hands electrically conductive objects or liquids that they've been submerged in. Turn off the electricity. The high voltage current can be transmitted for several meters around the victim. Look for the main power switch and turn it off. If this is not possible, look for a dry bad electrical conductor (wood, plastic, broomstick, bed board, etc.) to remove the electrical conductor or the victim. Before attempting any first aid intervention, check if the person is conscious and responsive. If they are not, call for emergency medical services immediately. Check the victim for movement, coughing and normal breathing. If the person is unresponsive, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP.For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top.

Heat stroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation. We give water or other non-alcoholic drinks.

Do Abrasions cause scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

It's important to note the time when symptoms first started, as this can help medical professionals determine the best treatment options. Help the person lie down and stay calm while waiting for emergency services to arrive. If the person stops breathing or their heart stops beating, perform CPR until emergency services arrive. Do not give the person any medications unless instructed to do so by a medical professional. If the person is conscious, support their head and neck to prevent any movement. If the person is wearing tight clothing, such as a tie or scarf, loosen it to ensure they can breathe comfortably.

How to cure Fainting?
Fainting, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. If you witness someone fainting, it's important to act quickly and catch the person and ease them to the ground to prevent further injury. Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall.

Begin with washed hands. Wash the cut with normal saline or plenty of clean water with a sterile gauze, cotton or a clean piece of cloth. Gently remove any dirt, glass or other materials if possible. If the cut is bleeding put pressure with a clean gauze or cloth continuously for a few minutes. When the bleeding stops clean the cut with antiseptic solution and cover it with a sterile adhesive bandage or wrap it with a sterile gauze pad and adhesive tape. Avoid covering the cut with cotton, because it can stick into the cut. If foreign objects cannot be removed, seek medical help. Change the wound every one to two days until it heals the wound. If you notice inflammation, intense swelling and redness or persisting pain, you should contact a doctor for the possible administration of an antibiotic, because the wound is infected. If the trauma was caused by a rusty object you must have a tetanus shot from a healthcare professional.

Do Abrasions because scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

Hot to cure <PAD>
Fainting, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. If you witness someone fainting, it's important to act quickly and catch the person and ease them to the ground to prevent further injury. Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall. Meanwhile, you can perform CPR. If you feel like you're going to pass out, lie down and place your legs higher or sit with your head between your legs.

<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> Do <PAD> Abrasions <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> cause <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

hypothermia Low body tempeture
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> Do Abrasions course scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation. We give water or other non-alcoholic drinks.

Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

Heat stroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

stroke
A stroke is defined as damage to the brain of vascular etiology, a stroke that originated either from an interruption of the blood supply to the affected area (ischemic), or from bleeding as a consequence of the rupture of a vessel (hemorrhagic). If we see a person with drooping of one side of the face, slurred speech, reduced or blurred vision, inability to raise an arm, dizziness, headache, we suspect a stroke and call for help. There are cases where the damage is great and we may lose consciousness until stopping. It's important to note the time when symptoms first started, as this can help medical professionals determine the best treatment options. Help the person lie down and stay calm while waiting for emergency services to arrive. If the person stops breathing or their heart stops beating, perform CPR until emergency services arrive. Do not give the person any medications unless instructed to do so by a medical professional. If the person is conscious, support their head and neck to prevent any movement. If the person is wearing tight clothing, such as a tie or scarf, loosen it to ensure they can breathe comfortably.

Dou Abrasions cause scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

De <PAD> <PAD> Abrasions <PAD> cause scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

Do Abrasions <PAD> scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

car heat <PAD> heatstroke high boday tempuiture
Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. If we become aware of the possibility of abandonment, we break the car window and remove the trapped person while simultaneously calling 116 or 112. So when we find a person in a similar environment who presents: red, warm and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache.

Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

hypothermia <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> Low <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> body <PAD> <PAD> temperature
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

Hot do you treate Faint?
Fainting, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. If you witness someone fainting, it's important to act quickly and catch the person and ease them to the ground to prevent further injury. Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall. Meanwhile, you can perform CPR. If you feel like you're going to pass out, lie down and place your legs higher or sit with your head between your legs.

<PAD> stroke heatstroke High blody tempretche
Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation. We give water or other non-alcoholic drinks.

Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall.

High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days.

If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache.

Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall.

High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

Heat stroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation.

If you witness someone fainting, it's important to act quickly and catch the person and ease them to the ground to prevent further injury. Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall. Meanwhile, you can perform CPR. If you feel like you're going to pass out, lie down and place your legs higher or sit with your head between your legs.

Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. If we become aware of the possibility of abandonment, we break the car window and remove the trapped person while simultaneously calling 116 or 112. So when we find a person in a similar environment who presents: red, warm and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation. We give water or other non-alcoholic drinks.

hypothermia Low <PAD> temperature
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

If we see a person with drooping of one side of the face, slurred speech, reduced or blurred vision, inability to raise an arm, dizziness, headache, we suspect a stroke and call for help. There are cases where the damage is great and we may lose consciousness until stopping. It's important to note the time when symptoms first started, as this can help medical professionals determine the best treatment options. Help the person lie down and stay calm while waiting for emergency services to arrive. If the person stops breathing or their heart stops beating, perform CPR until emergency services arrive. Do not give the person any medications unless instructed to do so by a medical professional. If the person is conscious, support their head and neck to prevent any movement. If the person is wearing tight clothing, such as a tie or scarf, loosen it to ensure they can breathe comfortably.
