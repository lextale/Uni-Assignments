Do Abrasions cause scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> heat stroke <PAD> <PAD> heatstroke High <PAD> <PAD> body temperature
Heatstroke is the rise in body temperature above 39C. It is the result of prolonged exposure to high temperature without simultaneous administration of fluids. High temperature can cause brain damage or even death. Heat stroke can be caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as under the sun even inside a parked car which can be long and in a very short time even on not particularly hot days. When we find a person with red, hot and dry skin, rapid breathing, confusion, convulsions or loss of consciousness, we should suspect heatstroke. We are calling for help. Put it in a tub of cool water or wet it with water. We place cold compresses or ice packs on the head, forehead, neck, armpits groin, use a fan. If the victim is conscious, give them water or other non-alcoholic drinks to drink. We start CPR if the victim shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing, movement. Long-term exposure to high temperature, in addition to heatstroke, can cause less life-threatening conditions, these are: Heat exhaustion, where the victim presents, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cramps, headache. We move the victim to a cool place. Wet it with water, give it water or other non-alcoholic drinks and painkillers in case of a headache. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions that usually occur during intense exercise in a hot environment. Loss of fluids and electrolytes often contribute to heat cramps. Relaxation. We give water or other non-alcoholic drinks.

DO NOT touch with bare hands electrically conductive objects or liquids that they've been submerged in. Turn off the electricity. The high voltage current can be transmitted for several meters around the victim. Look for the main power switch and turn it off. If this is not possible, look for a dry bad electrical conductor (wood, plastic, broomstick, bed board, etc.) to remove the electrical conductor or the victim. Before attempting any first aid intervention, check if the person is conscious and responsive. If they are not, call for emergency medical services immediately. Check the victim for movement, coughing and normal breathing. If the person is unresponsive, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP.For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise.  Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention.

<PAD> Abrasions because scars?
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

Do Abrasions course <PAD>
Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

hypothermia Low body temperature
Hypothermia is the drop in body temperature below 35C. It is the result of exposure to a cold environment or immersion in cold water. The risk of hypothermia increases when there is co-existing trauma, alcohol intake, or the victim suffers from some other illness. Thus, when we find a person in a similar environment who shows shivering, weakness or loss of consciousness, slow and shallow breathing, cold skin, we must suspect hypothermia. Call for help. Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.
